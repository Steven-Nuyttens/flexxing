        <h3>A little word about me</h3>
        <p>Hello dear visitor, My name is Steven Nuyttens and I made this page as an exercise to get familiar with html. It's a work in progress, but I've made a few divs wherein I wrote a short description. If you should have any questions, please do not
            hesitate to contact me.</p>

            <h3>GIT:</h3>
            <p>Git is a type of version control system (VCS) that makes it easier to track changes to files.For example, when you edit a file, git can help you determine exactly what changed, who changed it, and why.</p>
            Git has three main states that your files can reside in:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Modified</strong> means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.</li>

                <li><strong>Staged</strong> means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.</li>

                <li><strong>Committed</strong> means that the data is safely stored in your local database.</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Command Line:</h3>
            <p>Command line is a text interface to your computer.Often referred to as the shell, terminal, console, prompt or various other names, it can give the appearance of being complex and confusing to use.I found it a bit intimidating at first, but
                once you get the hang of it, it's a very great tool!</p>
        </div>


        <div id="html">
            <h3>HTML:</h3>
            <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.It allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, and blockquotes for web pages and applications. ...When working with HTML, we use simple code structures (tags and
                attributes) to mark up a website page.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="css">
            <h3>CSS:</h3>
            <p>CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent
                of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="sass">
            <h3>SASS:</h3>
            <p>Sass stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets Sass, and was created by Hampton Catlin. It’s a way to simplify your CSS workflow, making development and maintenance tasks easier. Sass introduces new concepts such as variables, mixins, nestings
                and selector inheritance. Sass looks similar to CSS, but without the semi-colons and curly braces.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="mediaqueries">
            <h3>Media Queries:</h3>
            <p>Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3. It uses the @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true.Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet (responsive
                web design) to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. You can also use media queries to specify that certain styles are only for printed documents or for screen readers (mediatype: print, screen, or speech).
